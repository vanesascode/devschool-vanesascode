        <p class="fs-5">Let's dive into them:</p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          1. What is JavaScript and what are its key features?
        </h4>

        <p class="fs-5">
          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is
          primarily used for web development. Its key features include being:

          <b>lightweight</b>,

          <b>versatile</b>, and
          <b>capable of running on both the client-side and server-side.</b>
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          2. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in
          JavaScript?
        </h4>

        <p class="fs-5">
          NULL represents the <b>intentional absence of any object value</b>
          <br /><br />

          UNDEFINED represents
          <b
            >a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a
            value.</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          In other words, null is a value that can be assigned to a variable,
          while undefined typically indicates an uninitialized variable.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4 class="my-5">3. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript?</h4>

        Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer
        lexical environment, even after the outer function has finished
        executing. They allow for data encapsulation, private variables, and
        creating functions with persistent state.

        <h4 class="my-5">
          4. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is based on objects. Each object
          has a prototype object from which it inherits properties and methods.
          When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks
          for it in the object itself, and if not found, it looks up the
          prototype chain until it finds the property or method.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          5. What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does it work?
        </h4>

        <p>
          The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous
          operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue.
          If the call stack is empty, it takes the next task from the queue and
          pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
        </p>

        <h4>6. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.</h4>

        <p>
          Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function
          declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
          compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the
          initializations.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          7. What are some ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?
        </h4>

        <p>
          Asynchronous operations in JavaScript can be handled using callbacks,
          promises, or async/await. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments
          to other functions and invoked once the asynchronous operation
          completes. Promises provide a more structured way of handling
          asynchronous operations, allowing chaining and error handling.
          Async/await is a syntax introduced in ES2017 that allows writing
          asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">8. How does the this keyword work in JavaScript?</h4>

        <p>
          The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing
          the current function. Its value is determined by how a function is
          called, and it can be influenced by the context in which the function
          is invoked.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          9. What are some common methods for manipulating arrays in JavaScript?
        </h4>

        <p>
          JavaScript provides several built-in methods for manipulating arrays,
          such as push() , pop() , shift() , unshift() , splice() , slice() ,
          concat() , forEach() , map() , filter() , reduce() , and many more.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-5">
          10. Explain the concept of function scope versus block scope in
          JavaScript.
        </h4>

        <p>
          In JavaScript, variables declared with var have function scope,
          meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which
          they are declared. On the other hand, variables declared with let and
          const have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the
          block they are defined in (e.g., within a loop or if statement).
