      <h2>Answers</h2>

      <h3>1. What is JavaScript and what are its key features?</h3>

      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is
        primarily used for web development. Its key features include being
        lightweight, versatile, and capable of running on both the client-side
        and server-side.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
      </h3>

      <p>
        null represents the <b>intentional absence of any object value</b>,
        while `undefined` represents a variable that has been declared but has
        not been assigned a value. In other words, null is a value that can be
        assigned to a variable, while undefined typically indicates an
        uninitialized variable.
      </p>

      ``` let x = null; console.log(x); // Output: null let y; console.log(y);
      // Output: undefined ```
      <h3>3. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript?</h3>

      Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer
      lexical environment, even after the outer function has finished executing.
      They allow for data encapsulation, private variables, and creating
      functions with persistent state.

      <h3>4. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?</h3>

      <p>
        Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is based on objects. Each object
        has a prototype object from which it inherits properties and methods.
        When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for
        it in the object itself, and if not found, it looks up the prototype
        chain until it finds the property or method.
      </p>

      <h3>5. What is the event loop in JavaScript and how does it work?</h3>

      <p>
        The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous
        operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. If
        the call stack is empty, it takes the next task from the queue and
        pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.</h3>

      <p>
        Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function
        declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the
        compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the
        initializations.
      </p>

      <h3>
        7. What are some ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Asynchronous operations in JavaScript can be handled using callbacks,
        promises, or async/await. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to
        other functions and invoked once the asynchronous operation completes.
        Promises provide a more structured way of handling asynchronous
        operations, allowing chaining and error handling. Async/await is a
        syntax introduced in ES2017 that allows writing asynchronous code in a
        more synchronous-like manner.
      </p>

      <h3>8. How does the this keyword work in JavaScript?</h3>

      <p>
        The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing
        the current function. Its value is determined by how a function is
        called, and it can be influenced by the context in which the function is
        invoked.
      </p>

      <h3>
        9. What are some common methods for manipulating arrays in JavaScript?
      </h3>

      <p>
        JavaScript provides several built-in methods for manipulating arrays,
        such as push() , pop() , shift() , unshift() , splice() , slice() ,
        concat() , forEach() , map() , filter() , reduce() , and many more.
      </p>

      <h3>
        10. Explain the concept of function scope versus block scope in
        JavaScript.
      </h3>

      <p>
        In JavaScript, variables declared with var have function scope, meaning
        they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are
        declared. On the other hand, variables declared with let and const have
        block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are
        defined in (e.g., within a loop or if statement).
